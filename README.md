# Temperate Blanket Project (Back)
Built off of my friend's base java app for Heroku (check him out: https://github.com/liester).  The front end for this project is [here](https://github.com/skylersidner/2017-06-03-temp-blanket-front).

Inspired by a friend's temperature blanket, where you stitch/knit/crochet a line into a blanket each day with the color based on the average temperature.  The goal is to have a fun way to visualize a "blanket" in the browswer based on historical weather data pulled in from an API.

Bonus options to add:
* Variable color schemes, chosen by user
* Variable color schemes, based on two colors and an algorithm
* Other temperature options like highs, lows, all-time highs or lows
* Other weather data points like humidity, wind, rainfall
* Scaling range for spread of colors
* Saveable settings

### Activity Log
